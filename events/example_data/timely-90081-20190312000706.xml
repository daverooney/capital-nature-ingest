<description>**BE ADVISED, we have updated the meeting location for the event due to the government shutdown. The National Park Service has requested there be no organized volunteer activities in Rock Creek Park, therefore we will be helping Rock Creek Park by cleaning up the communities nearby.**
Join Rock Creek Conservancy and the surrounding neighborhoods of Rock Creek Park as we celebrate the Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend of Service.

<description>Join Melanie Choukas-Bradley, the author of A Year in Rock Creek Park—the Wild, Wooded Heart of Washington, D.C. and the newly released The Joy of Forest Bathing—Reconnect with Wild Places &amp; Rejuvenate Your Life, for a walk under the trees in the Boundary Bridge area of Rock Creek Park. Susan Austin Roth, the Rock Creek Park book's photographer, and a Virginia Master Naturalist, will co-lead the walk, schedule permitting. Melanie and Susan are naturalists who frequently lead guided walks in the park, and they are intimately acquainted with the trees and wildflowers growing along Rock Creek. Melanie and Susan will share their love of nature and knowledge of the area’s ecology. See the last blaze of autumn glory in the trees and learn to identify them by their leaves, bark, acorns and other fall fruits. The enchanting, native witch-hazel will be in bloom and perhaps some fall wildflowers. The group will hope to catch the calls of pileated woodpeckers in the tall trees or the loud chatter of a belted kingfisher cruising the creek for fish, all while exploring some of the author’s and photographer’s favorite spots, including Boundary Bridge, the Skunk Cabbage Swamp, the Laurel Ledge, and Meditation Rock.
The tour will take place on Sunday, November 18th from 9:30 a.m. to roughly 1 p.m. The group will meet at the Boundary Bridge parking lot found along Beach Drive, where attendees can park. To get there, take the East-West Highway (Route 410) east from Connecticut Avenue (a right-hand turn if driving north on Connecticut from D.C. and a left-hand turn if driving south from the Beltway). Take the East-West Highway to Beach Drive and turn right (south) and drive to the locked gate across Beach Drive at the District line. Park in the parking lot just before the gate or along the road if the parking lot is full.
Because the tour should last up to 3 1/2 hours, attendees are encouraged to bring water, snacks, and a light lunch. In addition, sunscreen and bug spray may be needed. Bring binoculars if you wish.
We will cover up to 2 ½ miles at a slow hiking pace with some elevation change on hiking trails. There are no restrooms at the meeting location or along the route.
Price of the walk: $45 For more information, contact Bob Attardi at battardi@politics-prose.com. Register here.
Return Policy: Refunds are only guaranteed up to seven days before the trip.Tickets: https://www.politics-prose.com/rock-creek-park-walking-tour.</description>

Meeting Place: Boundary Bridge parking lot on Beach Drive at the DC/MD line (gate across Beach Drive). Park along Beach Drive if the parking lot is full. Carpooling recommended.
Registration Required (Limit 14): Register for the event here. Directions will be emailed following registration. 
Please Note: There are no restrooms at this location.
Join the Rock Creek Conservancy for a forest bathing walk led by certified nature and forest therapy guide Melanie Choukas-Bradley, award-winning author of A Year in Rock Creek Park and The Joy of Forest Bathing. We will meet at the edge of the Boundary Bridge parking lot and spend two hours slowly exploring the floodplain forest, tuning in to the beauty of the trees, birds and flowing water with all of our senses. Shinrin-yoku, or forest bathing, is a practice that began in Japan in the 1980s and has since grown popular around the world. It is rooted in the traditional Japanese reverence for nature. Rock Creek Park is an ideal place to practice forest bathing and we hope you will join us!

<description>We’re delighted that the author of the award-winning book, A Year in Rock Creek Park and the critically acclaimed, City of Trees, will offer her 13th year of nature walks for ANS in the country’s oldest urban national park. On our walk, we will witness the annual floral miracle of Virginia bluebells, spring beauties, and trout lilies in the floodplain forest, as we admire the leaves of tulip tree and American beech begin to spill from their buds. We’ll hope to catch bloodroot, wild ginger, cut-leafed toothwort and other spring ephemerals in bloom as we explore both floodplain and upland woods at a leisurely pace. Our lunch stop, high above the creek on a dramatic rock outcrop offering, will offer spectacular views. Here, we’ll do a bit of “forest bathing,” time permitting. Throughout, we’ll keep our eyes and ears open for belted kingfishers, wood ducks, migrating songbirds, and tiny spring peepers. REGISTER HERETickets: https://thriva.activenetwork.com/Reg4/(S(b2lswa0uiutp4iumygynsdgt))/Form.aspx?regkey=RpYOYPxE378wNjTYCkFkMw==&amp;qid=89775.</description>

<description>Anacostia Riverkeeper, funded by DOEE and working with multiple partner organizations (Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay, Audobon Naturalist Society, Potomac Riverkeeper Network, Rock Creek Conservancy), will be conducting District-wide weekly water sampling to inform the public about up-to-date water quality health as well as help inform long-term policy decisions about D.C. waterways.
They will be collecting water quality samples from 22 sites in D.C. on the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers, as well as Rock Creek. Each site will be sampled for bacteria, pH, and turbidity and then analyzed in the Anacostia Riverkeeper lab. Do not worry if these terms are unfamiliar: all will be taught in the training!  They need your help to sample these sites weekly throughout the summer! Sampling is done Wednesday and/or Thursday mornings. All data goes online 24-hours later after the samples are analyzed.
All interested volunteers are required to attend one training session that is from 2-3 hours. There will be three training days, the first is April 3rd from 10:00 AM-2:00 PM at the Earth Conservation Corps and the second April 10th from 10:00 AM- 2:00 PM at the Audobon Woodend Sanctuary. Please respond to this event with name and email to confirm attendance to the training.

Battery Kemble Park is one of the Civil War Defenses of Washington. At the time, Battery Kemble was located at an elevation on Ridge Road (now Nebraska Avenue). It was completed in the Autumn of 1861, as part of the Fort Circle. The battery held two 100-pounder Parrott rifles, placed in such a way as to sweep Chain Bridge and Virginia beyond.
Today, the parapet and gun positions are fairly well-preserved and remain visible. The site is located within Battery Kemble Park, bounded by Chain Bridge Road, MacArthur Boulevard, 49th Street, and Nebraska Avenue, NW. Battery Kemble was named after Gouveneur Kemble of Cold Springs, New York, former superintendent of West Point Foundry.Tickets: https://publicevents.secure.force.com/Public_Event_Signup_Page?cid=7010g000000n1Ro.</description>

Each site will be sampled for bacteria, pH, and turbidity and then analyzed in the Anacostia Riverkeeper lab. Do not worry if these terms are unfamiliar: all will be taught in the training!  They need your help to sample these sites weekly throughout the summer! Sampling is done Wednesday and/or Thursday mornings. All data goes online 24-hours later after the samples are analyzed.

Sessions are held in Rock Creek Park once each month on a Saturday night from April through November, starting shortly after sunset. We meet in the field just south of the intersection of Military and Glover Roads NW, near the Nature Center. A parking lot is located immediately next to the field.
Beginners (including children) and experienced stargazers are all welcome-and it's free!

<description>**BE ADVISED, we have updated the meeting location for the event due to the government shutdown. The National Park Service has requested there be no organized volunteer activities in Rock Creek Park, therefore we will be helping Rock Creek Park by cleaning up the communities nearby.**
Join Rock Creek Conservancy and the surrounding neighborhoods of Rock Creek Park as we celebrate the Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend of Service. 
In 2019, the Conservancy is focusing its restoration efforts on five &quot;mini-oases&quot; in Rock Creek Park in addition to the normal volunteer locations throughout the Rock Creek Watershed. These areas have been strategically chosen because they are important to the health of Rock Creek and they are important to the communities that live near them. We encourage you to see if there is a mini-oasis near you! 
We invite you to join volunteers from the Community to help keep the neighborhoods around our &quot;mini-oases&quot; clean. We hope to see you there!

<description>Join the Alice Ferguson Foundation and Rock Creek Conservancy as we partner to launch DC's first residential Adopt-A-Stream program!. This project will give interested leaders an opportunity to track levels of trash within DC's waterways utilizing the same resources and tools that researchers use to collect information on the Anacostia River's Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for trash. This citizen-science collected data will then be shared with the District Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) to help improve waterway quality in DC. Interested leaders must sign up for the next Adopt-A-Stream Training on Saturday, February 16 from 10:00 am -12:30 pm at the Cleveland Park Neighborhood Library located in Washington, DC. Transit details are included below. At the training leaders will learn about trash issues in DC Waterways and how to effectively track and document trash levels. 
You MUST register for this event: SIGN UP HERE What: The training will equip volunteers with the necessary information to track trash in a selected DC waterway. Trainees will also gain valuable tools as to how to successfully host trash cleanup efforts with volunteer energy.  As part of the training, volunteers will be taking a quick walk to a local waterway to see examples of trash and how to ID. Please be sure to wear comfortable shoes that may be a little dirty walking in the Park. 
When: Saturday, February 16, 2019, from 10:00 am to 12:30 pm.Where: Volunteers will meet at the Cleveland Park Neighborhood Library (3310 Connecticut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20008). The library is metro accessible via the Cleveland Park Metro station on the Red Line. Street Parking is also available.

<description>Join Rock Creek Conservancy and the National Park Service as we remove invasive plant species from the western section of Melvin Hazen.
In 2019, the Conservancy is focusing its restoration efforts on five &quot;mini-oases&quot; in Rock Creek Park in addition to the normal volunteer locations throughout the Rock Creek Watershed. These areas have been strategically chosen because they are important to the health of Rock Creek and they are important to the communities that live near them.

<description>Registration Required If you never learned to ride a bike or need to relearn the basics, this is the class for you! Our patient instructors use a series of skill-developing exercises to get you up on two wheels. You'll learn to start and stop smoothly while balancing comfortably on a bike. This class is the foundation of all our cycling classes, and is designed to prepare first-time riders to progress to the next class - Beginning Bike Skills (separate registration required). Our How to Ride a Bike class is for adults and kids 12 and older; for children 11 and under we offer a separate How to Ride a Bike for Kids class. REI bikes and bike helmets will be provided / For Children 12-17 years old, adults must be present at the class location.
