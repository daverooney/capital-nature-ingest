 the Civil War Defenses of Washington. At the time\, Battery Kemble was loc
 ated at an elevation on Ridge Road (now Nebraska Avenue). It was completed
  in the Autumn of 1861\, as part of the Fort Circle. The battery held two 
 100-pounder Parrott rifles\, placed in such a way as to sweep Chain Bridge
  and Virginia beyond.</p>\n<p>Today\, the parapet and gun positions are fa
 irly well-preserved and remain visible. The site is located within Battery
  Kemble Park\, bounded by Chain Bridge Road\, MacArthur Boulevard\, 49th S
 treet\, and Nebraska Avenue\, NW. Battery Kemble was named after Gouveneur
  Kemble of Cold Springs\, New York\, former superintendent of West Point F
 oundry.</p><p>Tickets: <a class='ai1ec-ticket-url-exported' href='https://
